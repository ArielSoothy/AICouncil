## ✅ RECENTLY COMPLETED (January 8, 2025):

**System Cleanup & Research Focus - COMPLETED**
- ✅ Disabled memory system cleanly (on backlog) with MEMORY_ENABLED = false flag
- ✅ Fixed agent model diversity bug - each agent now uses different Groq models:
  - Analyst: llama-3.1-8b-instant (fast initial analysis)
  - Critic: gemma2-9b-it (different architecture for diversity)
  - Synthesizer: llama-3.3-70b-versatile (best model for synthesis)
- ✅ Created comprehensive research validation framework (debate_research.md)
- ✅ Added defensive development patterns to WORKFLOW.md and CLAUDE.md
- ✅ Removed memory UI display from debate-interface.tsx
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript errors (consensus_fact → learned_fact)
- ✅ Archived memory docs to docs/archived/
- ✅ Clear focus established: PROVE multi-agent debate works (20-40% improvement target)

## ✅ PREVIOUSLY COMPLETED (September 7, 2025):

**Text Truncation System Fix - COMPLETED**

- PRIORITIES.md → Consolidated TODOs + current session context  
- BEST_PRACTICES.md → Development guidelines + feature protection
- FEATURES.md → Clean protected features list only
- Strategic Plan consolidated → Technical TODOs moved to PRIORITIES.md, vision merged into PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md, file deleted
- All markdown files consolidated → IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md + llm-mode-improvements.md merged into PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md, test examples added to BEST_PRACTICES.md
- FEATURES.md moved into project directory (no longer external)
- All documentation organized into docs/ directory → Clean project root, structured documentation  
- Added conversation prompt template → Reusable template in CLAUDE.md for consistent session transitions
- Enhanced workflow → CRITICAL: Update FEATURES.md when new features added (protect from deletion)

- Proper workflow: Work → Test → Document → Ask approval → Push → New prompt

## 🚀 NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES:

### 🎯 PRIMARY GOAL - PROVE THE RESEARCH WORKS:

**[READY TO IMPLEMENT]** 🔬 Research Validation & Deterministic Results
- **Goal**: Prove multi-agent debate produces consistent, superior results
- **Target Metrics**:
  - Accuracy improvement: ≥20% (statistical significance p < 0.05)
  - Consistency improvement: ≥40% (variance reduction)
  - Hallucination reduction: ≥25%
- **Validation Method**: See `debate_research.md` for complete methodology
- **Test Suite**: 200 queries across 5 categories (factual, mathematical, reasoning, creative, current)
- **Next Steps**:
  1. Implement test harness in `/test-research` page
  2. Run determinism tests (10x same query)
  3. Run accuracy tests with known answers
  4. Calculate statistics and p-values
  5. Document results in research report
- **Success Criteria**: Demonstrable, reproducible improvement over single models
- **Why This Matters**: This is the CORE VALUE PROPOSITION - everything else is secondary

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY - IMMEDIATE:

**[COMPLETED ✅]** 🌐 Web Search Integration 
- Progressive role-based web search system implemented
- DuckDuckGo integration with fallback providers
- Context-aware search queries for each agent

**[COMPLETED ✅]** 🧪 E2E Testing with Playwright MCP
- Comprehensive testing completed using Playwright MCP browser automation
- Verified live Vercel deployment at https://ai-council-new.vercel.app/
- Tested core agent debate functionality with 3 specialized agents
- Confirmed multi-round debate execution (2 rounds) with timeline display  
- Validated agent personas working properly (Analyst, Critic, Synthesizer)
- Fixed TypeScript error in role-based search system before testing

**[COMPLETED ✅]** 🏗️ Architecture Validation
- ✅ Enhanced timeline features + web search functionality tested with Playwright MCP

- **Phase 4**: Smart synthesis strategies (confidence + accuracy weighting)
- **Phase 5**: Benchmark suite + statistical validation

**[MEDIUM]** ⚨️ Performance Optimization
- Measure actual token usage per query type
- Calculate real costs for each mode
