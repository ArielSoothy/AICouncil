# Structured Prompt System Implementation

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a standardized prompt system that ensures all AI models provide consistent, fact-based responses while maintaining flexibility for different response lengths (concise, normal, detailed).

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Standardized Prompts
- **Fact-based requirements**: All models must base responses on verified facts, research, and data
- **Consistent structure**: Every response follows the same format for easy comparison
- **Uncertainty handling**: Models explicitly state when information is limited or uncertain
- **Evidence requirements**: Each response must include supporting evidence and limitations

### ðŸ“Š Structured Response Format
```
[MAIN ANSWER]
Clear, accessible answer (length varies by mode)

[CONFIDENCE: XX%]
Weighted confidence score (0-100%)

[KEY EVIDENCE]
â€¢ Supporting facts and research
â€¢ Source domains
â€¢ Additional supporting points

[LIMITATIONS]
â€¢ Acknowledged uncertainties
â€¢ Conditions where answer may not apply
â€¢ Information that would improve confidence
```

### ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

#### Core Files
- `lib/prompt-system.ts` - Prompt generation and response parsing
- `types/consensus.ts` - Enhanced with structured response types
- `app/api/consensus/route.ts` - Updated to use structured prompts
- `components/consensus/model-response-card.tsx` - Enhanced UI for structured data

#### Response Length Modes
- **Concise**: 1-2 sentences, core conclusion
- **Normal**: 3-5 sentences with reasoning
- **Detailed**: 6+ sentences with examples and nuances

### ðŸ’¡ Benefits

#### For Consensus Quality
- **Better Comparability**: Structured responses enable more accurate consensus analysis
- **Weighted Analysis**: Confidence scores help judge models weight responses appropriately
- **Evidence-Based**: Judge models can analyze the quality of evidence, not just conclusions
- **Uncertainty Awareness**: Explicit limitations improve consensus reliability

#### For Users
- **Transparency**: Clear evidence and limitations for each model response
- **Trust**: Confidence levels help users assess reliability
- **Understanding**: Structured format makes responses easier to parse and compare

### ðŸ§ª Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
npx tsx test-prompt-system.ts
```

Or use the demo:
```bash
./demo-structured-prompts.sh
```

### ðŸš€ Example Usage

```typescript
import { generateModelPrompt, parseModelResponse } from '@/lib/prompt-system'

// Generate structured prompt
const prompt = generateModelPrompt("What are the benefits of renewable energy?", "normal")

// Parse model response
const parsed = parseModelResponse(structuredResponse)
console.log(parsed.confidence) // 92
console.log(parsed.keyEvidence) // ["Cost reductions...", "IPCC reports..."]
```

### ðŸŽ¨ UI Enhancements

- **Structured Badge**: Responses show "Structured" indicator
- **Evidence Section**: Green checkmark with supporting evidence
- **Limitations Section**: Amber warning with acknowledged limitations
- **Confidence Display**: Clear percentage with color coding

### ðŸ“ˆ Impact on Consensus Analysis

The structured format enables the judge model to:
1. **Weight by Evidence Quality**: Responses with stronger evidence get more weight
2. **Identify Real Agreements**: Compare actual evidence, not just surface conclusions
3. **Handle Uncertainty**: Account for model confidence in final consensus
4. **Provide Better Explanations**: Use structured data to explain consensus reasoning

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Performance**: Track how structured prompts affect consensus quality
2. **Refine Prompts**: Iterate based on real-world usage patterns
3. **Add Analytics**: Measure evidence quality and confidence correlation
4. **Expand Modes**: Consider domain-specific prompt variations

This implementation maintains the flexibility of short/medium/long responses while dramatically improving the consistency and reliability of the consensus analysis process.
