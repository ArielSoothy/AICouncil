# Consensus AI

A multi-model AI decision engine that queries multiple AI providers and displays consensus analysis with smart minimization, judge analysis, and cost tracking.

## ‚ú® Features

### üéØ Smart Minimization
- **Concise Mode**: Max 50 words, direct answers (~75 tokens)
- **Normal Mode**: 100-150 words, balanced detail (~200 tokens)  
- **Detailed Mode**: Comprehensive with examples (~500 tokens)

### üß† Judge Model Analysis
- **Claude Opus 4** primary judge with structured JSON analysis
- **GPT-4o fallback** if Claude is unavailable  
- **Heuristic analysis** if both AI judges fail
- **Model weighting** based on expertise scores
- Unified answer generation with confidence scoring
- Agreements and disagreements identification with recommendations

### üí∞ Cost Tracking
- Real-time token usage monitoring
- **Claude Opus 4**: $15/MTok input, $75/MTok output
- **Claude Sonnet 4/3.7/3.5**: $3/MTok input, $15/MTok output  
- **Claude Haiku 3.5**: $0.80/MTok input, $4/MTok output
- **Claude Haiku 3**: $0.25/MTok input, $1.25/MTok output
- GPT models: $0.5-30/MTok depending on model
- Total cost calculation across all models and judge

### üîÑ Multi-Provider Support
- OpenAI (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o)
- Anthropic (Claude 3 family)
- Google (Gemini models)
- Dynamic model selection

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Fill in your API keys:
- **ANTHROPIC_API_KEY** - Required for Claude models
- **OPENAI_API_KEY** - Required for GPT models and judge analysis
- **GOOGLE_API_KEY** - Required for Gemini models
- **NEXTAUTH_SECRET** - Required for authentication

**Note**: The judge analysis feature requires an OpenAI API key. Without it, you'll still get individual model responses with smart minimization and cost tracking.

3. **Run the development server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app.

### Enhanced Response Structure

```json
{
  "query": "What are the benefits of exercise?",
  "mode": "normal",
  "responses": [
    {
      "model": "anthropic/claude-3-haiku-20240307",
      "response": "Exercise provides numerous benefits including improved cardiovascular health, enhanced mood through endorphin release, better sleep quality, increased strength and flexibility, weight management, and reduced risk of chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease.",
      "tokensUsed": 145,
      "responseTime": 1200
    }
  ],
  "consensus": {
    "unifiedAnswer": "All models agree that exercise provides significant health benefits...",
    "confidence": 95,
    "agreements": [
      "Improved cardiovascular health",
      "Better mental well-being",
      "Weight management benefits"
    ],
    "disagreements": [],
    "judgeTokensUsed": 87
  },
  "totalTokensUsed": 232,
  "estimatedCost": 0.00034
}
```

## Cost Transparency Features

### Model Selection Cost Display
- **Real-time Cost Visibility**: See exact input/output costs per 1K tokens for each model
- **Tier Classification**: Models are categorized as Free, Budget, Balanced, Premium, or Flagship
- **Efficiency Badges**: Visual indicators help you understand cost-effectiveness at a glance
  - üÜì Free models (Google's Gemini)
  - üí∞ Great Value (budget-friendly options)
  - ‚öñÔ∏è Balanced (good performance-to-cost ratio)
  - üíé Premium (high-performance, higher cost)
  - üèÜ Flagship (top-tier models, highest cost)

### Cost Analysis in Results
- **Individual Model Costs**: Each response shows its estimated cost
- **Detailed Breakdown**: Technical metrics include cost per model and judge analysis
- **Total Cost Tracking**: See overall spending for your consensus query
- **Transparent Pricing**: All costs based on 2025 pricing from official APIs

### Cost-Efficient Querying Tips
1. **Mix Tiers**: Combine flagship models with budget options for balanced insights
2. **Smart Mode Selection**: Use "concise" mode to reduce token usage and costs
3. **Model Expertise**: The system weighs model strengths for better judge analysis
4. **Free Models**: Google's Gemini models are completely free to use
