# CLAUDE.md - Master Index & Session Context

**AI Council Development - Structured Workflow System**

## 🚀 MANDATORY SESSION START PROTOCOL:
1. **Read this file** (current session context)
2. **Read docs/WORKFLOW.md** (step-by-step work method)  
3. **Read docs/PRIORITIES.md** (current TODO list)
4. **Read docs/FEATURES.md** (protected features)
5. **Read docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md** (architecture context)
6. **Optional: Read docs/BEST_PRACTICES.md** (debugging patterns)

## 📂 DOCUMENTATION STRUCTURE:

| File | Purpose | When to Read |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **docs/WORKFLOW.md** | Step-by-step session method | Every session start |
| **docs/PRIORITIES.md** | Current TODOs + progress | Every session start |
| **docs/FEATURES.md** | Protected features | Before any changes |
| **docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md** | Architecture + vision + status | For context |
| **docs/BEST_PRACTICES.md** | Debugging patterns | When issues arise |

## 📋 NEXT CONVERSATION PROMPT:

**Copy and paste to start next session:**

---

Continue AI Council development work.

Previous session: ✅ Documentation organization + All markdown files moved to docs/ directory completed
Next priority: 🧪 E2E Testing with Playwright MCP or 🏗️ Architecture validation (high priority tasks)

MANDATORY START: Read docs/CLAUDE.md → docs/WORKFLOW.md → docs/PRIORITIES.md → docs/FEATURES.md
TodoWrite: Next task from docs/PRIORITIES.md + "Update docs/PRIORITIES.md" + "Create next prompt"
Follow structured workflow: Work → Test → Document → Ask approval → Push → New prompt

---

## 📋 CONVERSATION PROMPT TEMPLATE:

**Use this template to create future conversation prompts:**

```
Continue AI Council development work.

Previous session: ✅ [Brief summary of what was completed]
Next priority: [Next high priority task from PRIORITIES.md]

MANDATORY START: Read docs/CLAUDE.md → docs/WORKFLOW.md → docs/PRIORITIES.md → docs/FEATURES.md
TodoWrite: Next task from docs/PRIORITIES.md + "Update docs/PRIORITIES.md" + "Create next prompt"
Follow structured workflow: Work → Test → Document → Ask approval → Push → New prompt
```

**Template Variables:**
- `[Brief summary of what was completed]` - 1-2 key achievements from the session
- `[Next high priority task from docs/PRIORITIES.md]` - Top item from docs/PRIORITIES.md high priority section

## 🎯 SESSION COMPLETION CHECKLIST:
- [ ] Work tasks completed
- [ ] docs/PRIORITIES.md updated with progress  
- [ ] ⚠️ docs/FEATURES.md updated if new feature added (add to protected list)
- [ ] Next conversation prompt updated
- [ ] User asked: "Any final observations?"
- [ ] Confirmed: "Documentation updated, next session prompt ready"

**This structured approach ensures bulletproof consistency across sessions.** 🔒
