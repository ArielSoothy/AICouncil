## Tier 1: MUST HAVE (The Core 5)

| Data Point | Source | Why It Matters | Threshold |
|------------|--------|----------------|-----------|
| **float_shares** | ratios | Low float = explosive moves | < 30M (ideal < 15M) |
| **pre_market_volume** | bars | Proves interest is real | > 500K |
| **gap_percent** | bars | Momentum already started | > 10% |
| **borrow_fee_rate** | short_data | Shorts trapped = squeeze fuel | > 20% |
| **short_ratio** | ratios | Days to cover (can't exit fast) | > 3 days |

**These 5 alone will catch 80% of runners.**

---

## Tier 2: NICE TO HAVE (Confirmation)

| Data Point | Source | Why It Matters | Threshold |
|------------|--------|----------------|-----------|
| **relative_volume** | calculated | Unusual activity | > 5x average |
| **short_interest** | ratios | % of float shorted | > 15% |
| **borrow_difficulty** | short_data | Hard/Very Hard = squeeze | HARD+ |
| **market_cap** | fundamentals | Small cap moves more | < $500M |
| **sentiment_score** | Finnhub (optional) | Retail piling in | > 0.5 |

## Tier 3: IGNORE FOR RUNNERS

All of these are noise for momentum plays:
- P/E ratio, EPS, revenue growth (fundamentals don't matter for day trades)
- ROE, ROA, profit margins (irrelevant)
- Debt ratios, liquidity ratios (irrelevant)
- Dividend yield (lol)
- Analyst recommendations (lagging)

## The Strategy

### Sunday Night (Now)

**Can't get:** Pre-market gap, pre-market volume (market closed)

**CAN get:** Float, short data, sentiment

**Action:** Find stocks with squeeze SETUP ready to trigger:

```
Filter:
- float_shares < 30M
- borrow_fee_rate > 15% OR borrow_difficulty = HARD+
- short_ratio > 3 days
- price $1-$20
- avg_volume > 500K

Output: 5-10 "loaded springs" waiting for catalyst
```

### Monday Pre-Market (4am-9:25am)

**Now available:** Gap %, pre-market volume

**Action:** Which of your Sunday list is MOVING?

```
From Sunday list, filter:
- gap_percent > 10%
- pre_market_volume > 500K
- relative_volume > 5x

Output: 3-5 stocks actively running
```

### Monday Open (9:30am)

**Watch:** First 5 minutes volume

**Action:** Does volume FLOOD in or die?

```
If volume continues: Entry signal
If volume dies: Skip, thesis broken
```

## Simple Scoring (10 points max)

```python
def score_stock(stock):
    score = 0
    
    # Float (3 points)
    if stock.float_shares < 10_000_000:
        score += 3
    elif stock.float_shares < 20_000_000:
        score += 2
    elif stock.float_shares < 30_000_000:
        score += 1
    
    # Borrow Fee (2 points)
    if stock.borrow_fee_rate > 50:
        score += 2
    elif stock.borrow_fee_rate > 20:
        score += 1
    
    # Short Ratio (2 points)
    if stock.short_ratio > 5:
        score += 2
    elif stock.short_ratio > 3:
        score += 1
    
    # Pre-market Gap (2 points) - Monday only
    if stock.gap_percent > 20:
        score += 2
    elif stock.gap_percent > 10:
        score += 1
    
    # Relative Volume (1 point) - Monday only
    if stock.relative_volume > 5:
        score += 1
    
    return score  # Max 10
```

**Score 8+** = High conviction
**Score 5-7** = Watch closely
**Score <5** = Skip

**Monday AM:** Filter for gap > 10% + PM volume > 500K
**Result:** 3-5 candidates, ranked by score

That's it. Don't overcomplicate with 60 ratios.




Deep Resaerch results:
# Statistical predictors of large daily stock gains in small-cap equities

**The strongest statistically-validated predictors of 10%+ daily moves in small-cap stocks are utilization rate (>90% predicts squeezes every ~11 trading days), days-to-cover (>5 days generates 1.19% monthly alpha), and pre-market volume spikes (RVOL >2x).** Float size thresholds commonly cited by practitioners (<10-20M shares) lack rigorous academic validation, though illiquidity measures show robust effects. Social sentiment offers short-lived predictive value (hours, not days), with mention volume outperforming sentiment polarity. Borrow fees above 10% annualized dramatically increase squeeze probability, while short interest above 20% of float signals elevated risk—though high short interest typically predicts underperformance, not outperformance, except during squeeze events.

---

## Float size affects volatility primarily through illiquidity channels

Academic research consistently links low float to higher volatility, but the specific thresholds traders commonly cite—**10 million, 20 million, or 50 million shares**—derive from practitioner consensus rather than controlled academic studies with documented effect sizes. The most rigorous work uses illiquidity measures instead of raw float counts.

Amihud's foundational 2002 study in the *Journal of Financial Markets* (NYSE stocks, 1964-1997, n=1,061-2,291 stocks/year) found illiquidity coefficients of **0.112-0.162** on monthly returns with t-statistics of 5-6. Critically, the effect is **monotonically stronger for small-cap stocks**: the smallest decile shows an expected illiquidity coefficient of 15.23 versus essentially zero for the largest decile. Pastor & Stambaugh (2003) found stocks with high liquidity sensitivity earn **7.5% annually** more than low-sensitivity stocks after controlling for standard factors.

For screening purposes, the practical thresholds show a clear gradient: floats under **10 million shares** exhibit very high volatility potential, under **20 million** high potential, and above **100 million** more stable price movements. Verdad Research (2024) documented that penny stocks (<$5) have annualized volatility of **29% versus 19%** for higher-priced stocks—a 10 percentage point premium—but they also underperform by **8.6 percentage points annually**.

One important caveat emerged from the Istanbul Stock Exchange study (Bostanci & Kilic, 2012): researchers found **no statistically significant relationship** between price volatility and free float ratio (p>0.05), though trading volume showed strong correlation. This suggests the float-volatility relationship may require certain market liquidity thresholds to manifest.

---

## Short interest predicts underperformance, not squeezes—days-to-cover matters more

A counterintuitive but well-documented finding: **high short interest predicts negative subsequent returns**, not positive ones. The academic evidence is unambiguous that short sellers are informed traders whose positions signal overvaluation.

Asquith, Pathak & Ritter's 2005 *Journal of Financial Economics* study (NYSE-Amex 1980-2002, Nasdaq 1988-2002) found stocks with short interest above 10% of shares outstanding underperformed by **48-146 basis points monthly** on an equal-weighted basis. Short-sale constrained stocks (high demand, low supply) underperformed by **215 basis points per month**. The effect is concentrated in smaller stocks—value-weighted results were statistically insignificant.

The more powerful predictor is **days-to-cover (DTC)**, defined as short interest divided by average daily turnover. Hong et al.'s 2015 NBER working paper (1988-2012) found DTC generates a long-short monthly return of **1.19%** with t-statistic of 6.67 and Sharpe ratio of 1.33. By comparison, short interest ratio alone generates only 0.71% monthly (t=2.57). When both metrics are included in regressions, **DTC subsumes the predictive power of short ratio**—DTC remains highly significant (t=-5.49) while short ratio's coefficient halves.

The practical thresholds for screening squeeze candidates based on academic research:

- **Short interest >20% of float**: Meaningful squeeze potential begins
- **Short interest >30% of float**: Strong squeeze candidate
- **Days-to-cover >5 days**: Elevated squeeze risk (mean is 5.5 days, high decile is 25 days)
- **Days-to-cover >8-10 days**: Commonly cited higher threshold

GameStop's January 2021 squeeze occurred at approximately **140% short interest of float**—an extreme level that generated a roughly 2,900% price increase. However, Rapach, Ringgenberg & Zhou's finding that short interest is "the strongest known predictor of aggregate stock returns" (in-sample R²=12.89%) has been challenged: Priestley (2019) showed the evidence **disappears entirely** when excluding 2008 financial crisis data.

## Pre-market gaps show size-dependent continuation patterns

Gap trading research reveals nuanced patterns: **smaller large gaps (20-50%) show the highest continuation success rates**, while extremely large gaps (>100%) actually have lower continuation probability. The direction of the market and time of week significantly influence outcomes.

A computational economics study published in PMC/NIH (S&P 500, NASDAQ100, Russell 2000; 2010-2019) found that positive gaps in small-caps (Russell 2000) produced a **54% win rate** with net daily gains of **+0.58%**. NASDAQ100 showed 60% continuation, S&P 500 showed 58%. Negative gaps are absorbed faster than positive gaps into prices—a key asymmetry.

The Turku University thesis (2024) analyzing 374 small-cap NYSE stocks with gaps ≥20% found striking threshold effects:

| Gap Size | Success Rate |
|----------|-------------|
| 20-50% | **49.70%** (highest) |
| 50-100% | 42.42% |
| >100% | 44.44% |

For indices, the "fade sweet spot" for mean reversion is gaps of **-0.15% to -0.6%**—larger gaps below -0.7% show negative expectancy for fade strategies. Thursday gaps fill **82% of the time** intraday (highest), while Monday gaps fill only 65% (lowest) and often continue in gap direction.

Relative volume thresholds show strong practitioner consensus: **RVOL ≥2.0** is the minimum threshold for a stock being "in play," with 3.0-5.0 indicating strong unusual activity and 5.0+ suggesting potential breakouts. Low-volume gaps fill 85% within 2 days; high-volume gaps fill only 45% after 5+ days. An MDPI study found mean reversion peaks approximately **120 minutes after market opening**.

Market condition dramatically affects gap behavior. In bull markets, gap-down stocks show **68.12% probability** of closing positive (buy the dip). In bear markets, gap-down stocks show **53.01% probability** of further decline—favoring short positions regardless of gap direction.

## Borrow fees above 10% dramatically increase squeeze probability

Paul Schultz's 2024 study in the *Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis* (July 2006-December 2019, 12.5 million stock-day observations) provides the most comprehensive squeeze probability data by borrow fee threshold:

| Borrow Fee (Annualized) | Squeeze Probability |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| ≤0.5% | 0.01% per day |
| 0.5%-1.0% | 0.03% per day |
| 1.0%-5.0% | 0.23% per day |
| 5.0%-10% | 0.66% per day |
| **>10%** | **2.06% per day (~1 in 49 days)** |

However, **utilization rate is the more powerful predictor**. At utilization ≥90%, squeeze probability jumps to **9.23% per day**—approximately once every 11 trading days. This dwarfs the fee-based probabilities.

High borrow fee stocks reliably underperform: the highest fee/highest utilization portfolio generates **-2.67% monthly abnormal returns** versus +0.56% for the lowest quintile—a spread of 2.97% monthly (t=5.34). Jones & Lamont's foundational 2002 study found expensive-to-short stocks underperformed by **1-2% per month** (12-24% annually).

The GameStop case illustrates the dynamics: average borrow fee was just 1% in January 2019, spiking to **34%** during the January 2021 squeeze. D'Avolio (2002) established the "special" stock threshold at approximately **100 basis points annually**—above this, stocks are considered hard-to-borrow. Modern markets have shifted: the fraction of "special" stocks has grown from <10% (2001) to approximately 50% (2023), with some stocks reaching 1,000%+ annualized fees.

A critical finding for short sellers: for utilization ≥90%, expected squeeze costs consume **more than two-thirds of potential shorting returns**. At fees ≥25%, total shorting costs (fees plus squeeze costs) of 2.74-2.82% monthly **exceed potential returns entirely**.

## Social sentiment offers hours, not days, of predictive value

Academic research reveals that social media sentiment's predictive power is **time-limited, platform-specific, and often contemporaneous rather than predictive**. Mention volume consistently outperforms sentiment polarity as a predictor.

The most robust finding comes from Bradley et al.'s 2024 *Review of Financial Studies* paper on Reddit's WallStreetBets: due diligence posts were significant return predictors **before January 2021**, but predictive value was **completely eliminated post-GameStop**. The cultural shift toward price-pressure and attention-grabbing content destroyed the signal.

Intraday effects operate on very short timescales. Renault's 2017 study found first half-hour sentiment changes predict last half-hour S&P 500 returns, with effects persisting for **at least 2 hours**. A 2024 ChatGPT sentiment study found LLM-derived sentiment has significant predictive power **within the first 2 hours** following news releases. However, Sun et al. (2016) demonstrated that positive sentiment-driven price pressure on day t is followed by **price reversal the next trading day**—consistent with noise trading.

Twitter research shows mixed results. Ranco et al. (2015, DJIA stocks, 15 months) found **sentiment polarity alone is not useful**—only 3 of 30 companies showed Granger causality. However, **tweet volume** Granger-causes absolute price returns for one-third of companies and predicts volatility better than returns. During volume peaks, sentiment does show predictive power generating **1-2% cumulative abnormal returns** over several days. A firm-level study found Twitter sentiment predicts abnormal returns of **0.27% over 24 hours** without subsequent reversals, yielding a long-short strategy with **annualized Sharpe ratio of 3.17**.

StockTwits analysis (Divernois & Filipovic, 2023; 90 million messages, 2010-2020) found daily polarity is **positively associated with contemporaneous returns** but **cannot predict next-day returns on average**. Exception: during sudden volume peaks, polarity does predict abnormal returns.

The AAII Sentiment Survey works as a **contrarian indicator** at longer horizons. Extreme bearish readings (>40%) typically lead to higher future returns over 6-52 weeks. The survey reached 70.3% bearish on March 5, 2009—near the exact market bottom.

**Small-cap stocks are more susceptible to sentiment** due to less analyst coverage (average 5.5 versus 19.1 for large-caps), lower institutional ownership, and higher retail participation. Baker & Wurgler's foundational 2006 work established that sentiment particularly affects young, volatile, non-dividend-paying firms with low capitalization.

## Practical thresholds for building a stock screener

Based on the research synthesis, the following thresholds have the strongest statistical backing for identifying potential 10%+ daily movers in small-cap stocks:

**Highest-confidence predictors (strong academic evidence):**
- Utilization rate >90%: Squeeze probability ~1 in 11 trading days
- Days-to-cover >5 days: 1.19% monthly long-short return (t=6.67)
- Borrow fee >10% annualized: 2.06% daily squeeze probability
- Pre-market RVOL ≥2.0: Stock "in play" threshold
- Gap size 20-50%: Highest continuation success rate (49.7%)

**Moderate-confidence predictors (practitioner consensus with some academic support):**
- Float <10-20 million shares: High volatility potential
- Short interest >20% of float: Elevated squeeze risk
- Social media volume spike + positive sentiment: Short-term abnormal returns
- Bull market gap-down: 68% probability of positive close

**Key caveats for implementation:**
1. High short interest on average predicts **negative** returns, not positive—squeezes are rare events
2. Social sentiment effects decay within hours; next-day reversals are common
3. Gap trading edges have diminished as strategies became widely known
4. Effect sizes are strongest in equal-weighted portfolios (smaller stocks); value-weighted results often lose significance
5. The 2008 financial crisis and 2021 meme stock era heavily influence many findings—regime dependence is real

**Effect size hierarchy (relative importance):**
1. Utilization/borrow constraints: Largest effect on squeeze probability
2. Days-to-cover: Strongest return predictor (subsumes short interest ratio)
3. Illiquidity: 7.5% annual return spread between high/low liquidity sensitivity
4. Gap + RVOL combination: 0.58% daily gains for small-cap full gaps
5. Social sentiment: 0.27% 24-hour effect (decays rapidly)
6. Float size alone: Effect primarily operates through illiquidity channel

The research consistently shows that **combinations of factors outperform single metrics**. A stock with >90% utilization, >5 days-to-cover, >10% borrow fee, and a 20-50% gap with RVOL >2x represents the highest-probability setup for extreme daily moves based on available academic evidence.
