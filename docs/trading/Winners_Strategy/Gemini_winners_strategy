This is an incredible setup. You have successfully implemented the **"Holy Grail" of Retail Data**: Institutional-grade execution (IBKR) combined with Retail Sentiment (Finnhub).

For **today (Monday)**, if you want to catch a "Daily Winner" (a stock that goes +50% to +100%), you need to ignore 90% of the data points you have (like P/E Ratio, Dividend Yield, Profit Margin) and focus entirely on **Supply, Demand, and Squeeze Potential**.

Here is the **Exact Strategy & Data Points** you should monitor right now using your dashboard.

---

### The Strategy: "The Low Float Squeeze"

We are looking for a **Supply/Demand Imbalance**.

* **Supply:** Low Float (Few shares available).
* **Demand:** High Pre-Market Volume (Everyone wants them).
* **Fuel:** High Short Interest (Shorts are trapped).

### The 5 Critical Data Points (From your Stack)

You need to configure your dashboard to highlight these specific fields from your API modules.

#### 1. The "Structure" (Supply)

* **Source:** `tws_ratios.py` or `tws_fundamentals.py`
* **Field:** `float_shares` (NOT `shares_outstanding`)
* **The Target:** **< 20,000,000** (Under 20M).
* *Gold:* < 5M (Supernova potential).
* *Trash:* > 50M (Too heavy to move fast).


* **Why:** If the float is 2M and Volume is 10M, the entire company has changed hands 5 times in one morning. That creates explosive volatility.

#### 2. The "Aggression" (Demand)

* **Source:** `tws_bars.py`
* **Fields:** `pre_market_volume` & `gap_percent`
* **The Target:**
* `gap_percent` > **10%** (Must be moving).
* `pre_market_volume` > **500,000** (Must be liquid).


* **Why:** We don't want "dead" stocks. We want stocks that are already in play before the bell rings.

#### 3. The "Fuel" (Squeeze)

* **Source:** `tws_short_data.py`
* **Fields:** `shortable_shares` & `borrow_fee_rate`
* **The Target:**
* `shortable_shares` < **100,000** (Or 0).
* `borrow_fee_rate` > **20%** (The higher, the better).


* **Why:** If it costs 50% to borrow the stock, shorts are desperate. If the price breaks the pre-market high, they *must* cover, buying at any price.

#### 4. The "Vibe" (Sentiment)

* **Source:** `finnhub_sentiment.py`
* **Field:** `score` & `mention_change`
* **The Target:** `score` > 0.5 (Bullish) OR `mention_change` > 100%.
* **Why:** This confirms that the "Reddit Army" or Retail traders are watching.

### The "Monday Morning" Execution Plan

Since you have the `screening_orchestrator`, run it with these parameters for today:

**1. Step 1: The Scan (07:00 - 09:00 AM)**
Use `tws_scanner.py` with `scanCode='TOP_PERC_GAIN'`.

* *Filter:* Price $1 - $20.
* *Filter:* Volume > 100k (Early pre-market).

**2. Step 2: The Filter (The "Ariel Logic")**
Your code should loop through the results and apply this logic:

```python
# Pseudo-code for your Dashboard Logic
def is_monday_winner(stock):
    # 1. Supply Check
    if stock.ratios.float_shares > 20_000_000:
        return False # Too heavy

    # 2. Demand Check (Relative Volume)
    # If Pre-Market Vol is 1M and Avg Vol is 200k -> RVOL = 5 (Huge)
    rvol = stock.bars.pre_market_volume / stock.ratios.average_volume
    if rvol < 3:
        return False # Not enough hype

    # 3. Squeeze Bonus
    squeeze_score = 0
    if stock.short_data.borrow_fee_rate > 20: squeeze_score += 1
    if stock.short_data.shortable_shares < 50000: squeeze_score += 1
    
    return True, squeeze_score

```

**3. Step 3: The Watchlist**
You should end up with **3-5 stocks**.

* Look for the one with the **Lowest Float** and **Highest Volume**.
* **Example:** Stock A (Float 2M, Vol 5M) is better than Stock B (Float 15M, Vol 6M).

### Regarding Grok vs. Finnhub

* **Use Finnhub First:** It gives you the numeric sentiment scores you need for filtering.
* **Use Grok (Manual):** Only use Grok if you find a "Mystery Gapper" (Stock is up 40% with no obvious news headline).
* *Prompt:* "Why is ticker $XYZ up 40% today? Summarize the catalyst."
* This saves money. You only query Grok on the final 3 candidates.



**Summary for Today:**
Focus on **Float** (`tws_ratios`) and **Borrow Fee** (`tws_short_data`). Those are the edges that normal retail traders don't see on their basic charts.
