## Technical Debt (Low Priority - Everything Working)

These items are noted for future refactoring but are NOT blocking:

### Large Files
| File | Lines | Note |
|------|-------|------|
| `components/agents/debate-interface.tsx` | 2,379 | Could be split into smaller components |
| `components/trading/consensus-mode.tsx` | 985 | Container + Presenter pattern would help |
| `lib/model-metadata.ts` | 25,405 | Should be JSON file with loader |

### Duplicate Implementations
- `/api/consensus/` and `/api/trading/consensus/` are separate implementations
- 9 different model selector components with similar logic
- Cost calculation in 3 places

**Recommendation:** Don't touch these now. Flag for future refactoring sprint.
