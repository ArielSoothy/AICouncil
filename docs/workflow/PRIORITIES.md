# 🎯 CURRENT PRIORITIES & SESSION PROGRESS

## 📚 REQUIRED CONTEXT FOR AI - READ THESE BASED ON WORK MODE:

**🔴 CRITICAL: When working on ANY trading features, ALWAYS read:**
- `/Users/user/AI-Counsil/AICouncil/docs/features/TRADING_ENHANCEMENTS.md` - Complete trading system documentation
- `/Users/user/AI-Counsil/AICouncil/PAPER_TRADE.MD` - Paper trading implementation details

**Other context-specific docs (see DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md for full list):**
- Ultra Mode/Consensus work → `docs/architecture/AI_MODELS_SETUP.md`
- Agent Debate work → `docs/guides/SUB_AGENTS.md`
- Database changes → `docs/architecture/SUPABASE_SETUP.md`

**📜 Historical completed work:** See `docs/workflow/PRIORITIES_ARCHIVE.md` for all previously completed features

## 📝 CURRENT SESSION CONTEXT:

**Current Session:** ✅ **WORKING CHECKPOINT** - Judge Error Fix + Error Taxonomy (December 17, 2025)
**Goal:** Fix judge "empty response" error in Sub Pro mode, comprehensive error handling docs

**Progress:**
- ✅ **CRITICAL FIX:** Judge was hardcoded to API provider, ignored Sub Pro/Max tier
- ✅ Root cause: `const judgeProvider = PROVIDERS.anthropic` (always API, never CLI)
- ✅ Fixed: Judge now uses `getProviderForModelAndTier()` like decision models
- ✅ Sub Pro/Max: Uses ClaudeCLIProvider (subscription)
- ✅ Pro/Max: Uses AnthropicProvider (API)
- ✅ Added error classification to judge (matches decision model pattern)
- ✅ Sub mode bug detection: Alerts if BUDGET_LIMIT appears (should NEVER happen)
- ✅ Created ERROR_TAXONOMY.md (838 lines, 15 error categories)
- ✅ Documented all failure modes: rate limit, budget, auth, CLI, tools, JSON, etc.

**The Bug:**
```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE: Judge ignored tier
const judgeProvider = PROVIDERS.anthropic; // Always API

// ✅ AFTER: Judge respects tier
const { provider: judgeProvider } = getProviderForModelAndTier('anthropic', researchTier);
```

**Why It Failed:**
1. User selected Sub Pro mode (subscription, uses CLI not API)
2. Decision models correctly used ClaudeCLIProvider
3. Judge was hardcoded to AnthropicProvider (API)
4. No ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in Sub mode
5. Result: "Unable to analyze - empty response"

**Files Modified:**
- `app/api/trading/consensus/stream/route.ts` - Judge provider + error classification
- `docs/guides/ERROR_TAXONOMY.md` - NEW: 15 error categories with detection/fix guides
- `DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md` - Added ERROR_TAXONOMY.md reference

**Commits:**
- `b894837` - fix(judge): Add error handling for judge model failures
- `b85e3dd` - fix(judge): Use tier-aware provider selection + error classification
- `91a37f9` - docs: Add comprehensive ERROR_TAXONOMY.md (15 error types)

**Previous Session:** ✅ Arena Real-Time Prices + CLI Provider Fixes (December 15, 2025)
**Goal:** Fix Arena price guessing bug, verify CLI subscription mode, end-to-end test

**Progress:**
- ✅ Fixed Arena price bug - models now use real-time Alpaca prices
- ✅ Added `fetchCurrentPrices()` to get 31 stock prices from Alpaca API
- ✅ CLI providers properly remove API keys from env (subscription mode)
- ✅ TLS warning filter (Node.js warnings not treated as errors)
- ✅ ProviderBadge shows 🔑 CLI / 🌐 API on all Arena results
- ✅ End-to-end test with Groq FREE model (llama-3.3-70b-versatile)
- ✅ Test result: AAPL entry $274.67 vs current $274.71 (< 0.02% error!)
- ✅ No mock data, no fake fallbacks - production ready

**Before vs After:**
| Model | Before (Training Data) | After (Real-Time) |
|-------|------------------------|-------------------|
