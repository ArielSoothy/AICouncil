# Claude Code Development Guide - MVP Features
*Consensus AI Development Priorities & User-Driven Feature Building*

## 🎯 DEVELOPMENT PHILOSOPHY

Build only what users actually need based on real feedback and usage patterns. The consensus AI already works and provides value - everything else is optimization driven by user behavior.

## 🚀 ESSENTIAL FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT

### User Feedback Collection System
Create a feedback mechanism that appears after users view consensus results. Include a simple rating system where users can indicate whether the consensus was helpful or not, along with an optional text field for comments. This feedback should be stored and easily accessible for review to understand what's working and what needs improvement.

### Email Collection for User Communication
Add an unobtrusive email signup option in the header or footer area where users can voluntarily provide their email address to receive product updates. This helps build a direct communication channel with engaged users for future iterations and announcements.

### Clear Value Proposition Explanation
Create a prominent explanation on the main interface that clearly communicates what the tool does and why it's valuable. Explain that users get answers from three specialized AI agents who debate the question, that users can see the reasoning and disagreements, and that this approach provides better results than single AI responses for complex questions.

### Basic Usage Analytics
Implement simple tracking to monitor daily query volumes, user engagement patterns, and feedback trends. Track which types of questions users submit most frequently and whether they engage with follow-up queries. This data helps identify successful use cases and areas for improvement.

## 📊 USER BEHAVIOR MONITORING

### Feedback Pattern Analysis
Monitor the ratio of positive to negative user feedback and categorize the types of queries that receive the best responses. Save user comments for detailed review to identify specific pain points or areas where the consensus approach provides exceptional value.

### Usage Pattern Recognition
Track daily query volumes and identify peak usage times to understand user behavior. Monitor whether users submit multiple queries in a session, which indicates engagement and satisfaction with results. Observe which consensus results users choose to share externally, as this indicates content that provides obvious value.

### Engagement Quality Assessment
Identify queries that generate the most detailed agent debates and high user satisfaction. Look for patterns in question complexity that produce the most valuable consensus outcomes. Track user session duration and interaction depth to understand how thoroughly users engage with results.

## 🎯 USER-DRIVEN FEATURE DEVELOPMENT

### Response to Length Feedback
When users indicate that consensus results are too verbose, implement a summary view that shows just the final consensus with an option to expand full agent details. This addresses user preference for concise information while preserving the detailed reasoning for those who want it.

### Comparison Feature Requests
If users express interest in comparing consensus results with single AI responses, add a comparison mode that shows both approaches side by side. This helps users understand the specific value the consensus approach provides for their particular questions.

### Question Guidance Improvements
When users seem uncertain about what types of questions work best with the consensus approach, create an example library of effective queries across different categories like research, decision-making, creative brainstorming, and complex analysis.

### Sharing and Social Features
If users begin sharing consensus results on social platforms, implement clean sharing functionality with properly formatted result cards that present the consensus clearly when shared externally.

## 🔧 ITERATIVE IMPROVEMENT APPROACH

### Feedback-Driven Development
Prioritize improvements based on recurring user feedback themes rather than theoretical feature lists. When multiple users request similar functionality or report similar issues, those become development priorities.

### Usage Pattern Optimization
Adjust agent prompts and system behavior based on the types of questions users actually submit. If usage data shows preference for certain query categories, optimize the agent specializations for those specific use cases.

### Performance and Experience Refinement
Monitor user engagement metrics to identify drop-off points in the user experience. Address technical performance issues that impact user satisfaction, such as response times or interface clarity.

## 📈 FEATURE PRIORITIZATION CRITERIA

### High Priority Indicators
Implement features when multiple users explicitly request the same functionality, when you personally experience the limitation while using the product, or when the improvement can be implemented quickly without disrupting core functionality.

### Analytics Implementation Threshold
Add comprehensive analytics tools when daily usage reaches consistent levels that make manual tracking difficult, when you're losing track of feedback manually, or when you need detailed data to make informed development decisions.

### Advanced Feature Consideration
Develop complex new features only when current functionality feels limiting to regular users, when users repeatedly suggest specific improvements, or when you have sustainable growth and engagement that justifies expanded functionality.

## ❌ FEATURES TO AVOID UNTIL PROVEN NECESSARY

Resist building user account systems, payment processing, complex onboarding flows, mobile applications, API endpoints, team collaboration features, custom model selection interfaces, or memory systems between queries until users explicitly demonstrate need for these capabilities through their feedback and usage patterns.

## 🏆 SUCCESS INDICATORS

### User Engagement Signals
The product is succeeding when people use it without prompting, when users leave detailed comments describing specific value they received, when clear patterns emerge in the types of questions users prefer, and when usage grows organically through word-of-mouth.

### Development Success Metrics
Development efforts are on track when user feedback becomes more specific and constructive, when feature requests align with actual usage patterns, when users express satisfaction with recent improvements, and when you can identify clear next steps based on user behavior data.

## 💡 DEVELOPMENT FOCUS PRINCIPLES

The consensus AI functionality works effectively and provides differentiated value. All additional development should be optimization based on real user needs rather than theoretical improvements. Focus on understanding user behavior through feedback and usage data, then build exactly what users demonstrate they want through their actions and requests.

Let user behavior and explicit feedback guide all development priorities rather than assumptions about what might be useful. The goal is to enhance the existing valuable functionality rather than add complexity that users haven't requested.
